# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose 
  Analyze and create a visualization for the analysis, of how the data differs by city type, and how those differences can be used by decison-makers at PyBer. To do this we created a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
  ### Analysis from DataFrame
  Following is the screen shot for the summary from the DataFrame

  From the above summary we observe that
  
    1. Rural type cities have the least number for total rides, total drivers, and least amount for total fares.
    2. Rural type cities have the most dollor amount for Average Fare per Ride , and Average Fare per Drive.
    3. Urban type cities have the most number for total rides, total drivers, and most dollar amount for total fares.
    4. Urban type cities have the least dollor amount for Average Fare per Ride , and Average Fare per Drive.
   
  ### Analysis from Line Graph 
  Following is the screenshot frrom the line graph we did for total weekly of the fares of each type of city

  From the visualization of this summary (line graph), we observe that
  
    1. Rural cities have the highest amount of fare collected in the beginning of April
    2. Rural cities have the lowest amount of fare collected in second week of January
    3. Suburban cities have the highest amount of fare collected towards the end of February
    4. Suburban cities have the lowest amount of fare collected in beginning of January
    5. Urban cities have the highest amount of fare collected in the last week of February and in the first week of March
    6. Urban cities have the lowest amount of fare collected in beginning of January
    
 ## Summary
   Looking through the analysis, we can recommend that 
   1. Recruit more drivers in Rural cities
   2. Suggest an increase in Fare for Urban cities
   3. Suggest a min price of $20 for ride in Urban cities
